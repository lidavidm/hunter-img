This repository contains a sample implementation of Insertion Minimalist Grammars and Conjunctivist semantics, as defined in Hunter (2011) /Syntactic Effects of Conjunctivist Semantics/.

The source code is provided as a literate org-mode file. File =hunter.ml= contains a pre-tangled version of the code (i.e. just the source code, without accompanying commentary).
